Man page install location
=========================

At the moment the man page will be installed only in the directory
$PREFIX/share/man/man1 if it is existing. Needs to be more sophisticated.

Recognition of correct file type
================================

The correct file type is not always recognized by using the 'file' command.
This may be due to old versions of 'file'. The support for Openoffice files
e.g. is not contained in 'magic files' from file-4.16 or older.
In addition there are ambiguities, so that an UTF-16 file may be reported as
MPEG ADTS, layer I, v1 file. This could be corrected by supplying a magic file
tailored to the needs of lesspipe. Such a file could be provided.
